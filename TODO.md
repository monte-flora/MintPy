### TODO List 
```
[X] Add plotting function for the multipass permutation importance results
[X] Add a dynamic method for plotting subplots for the ALE and PDP plots (E.g., pnum = len(args.m)
fig, ax_arr = plt.subplots(pnum, sharex=True, sharey=True)) 
<<<<<<< HEAD
[ ] Add plotting call into the model_clarify_class
[x] Include parallezation to ALE, PD calculations (Shawn took a stab at this, may not be best)
[ ] Look into cases where data is normalized
[x] Convert tree interpretator to class
[ ] How to handle plotting correctly for tree interpreter and permutation importance
=======
[X] Add plotting class into the model_clarify_class
[ ] Compress the compute treeinterpreter code. 
[ ] Add legend to the PDP and ALE plots
